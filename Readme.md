## Kerberos Authentication in Identity Cloud Using Identity Gateway
### Prerequisites
1. Kerberos authentication must be enabled in Active Directory.
2. Install Identity Gateway and ensure the Java environment truststore is setup to trust server certificates.
3. Ensure the Identity Gateway and the Active Directory servers can reach one another.
4. Synchronize the time between the Identity Gateway and the Active Directory server.
5. Create krb5.conf in the Java environment /lib/security/ directory.  Here is a sample [krb5.conf](https://github.com/ForgeRock/tntp-kerberos-cloud/blob/main/samples/krb5.conf) file.
6. Create spengo.conf.  Here is a sample [spengo.conf](https://github.com/ForgeRock/tntp-kerberos-cloud/blob/main/samples/spnego.conf) file. You will need the path of this file in a later step.
7. Issue the following command on the Active Directory server assuming **demoig.server.frdpcloud.org** is the fully qualified domain name of the Identity Gateway Server and **igsa** is the service account samaccountname: 
      >setspn -s HTTP/demoig.server.frdpcloud.org igsa
8. Follow the [Gateway Communication node](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/idcloud/latest/release-notes/rapid-channel/auth-node-gateway-comm.html) setup.
